      "You are a tech consultant, and you have been given the following request:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Make a presentation about building a system which takes an internal company database of contract documents, and based on a user query, helps find the most relevant contract document\"\n",
      "\n",
      "After consulting with a senior software engineer, he has provided you the following approach to build such a system:\n",
      "\"## Brainstorming: Contract Document Search System\n",
      "\n",
      "**Goal:** Build a system that takes an internal company database of contract documents and, based on a user query, helps find the most relevant contract document.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cutting-Edge Approach:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The most cutting-edge approach would leverage **vector embeddings** and **large language models (LLMs)**. This allows for semantic search, going beyond keyword matching to understand the meaning and context of both the query and the contract documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Document Preprocessing:**\n",
      "    * **Optical Character Recognition (OCR):** If contracts are scanned images, use OCR to extract text.\n",
      "    * **Cleaning and Normalization:** Remove noise, standardize formatting, and handle special characters.\n",
      "    * **Chunking:** Divide large contracts into smaller, manageable chunks (paragraphs or sections) to improve context and relevance scoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Embedding Generation:**\n",
      "    * **Sentence Transformers:** Use pre-trained sentence transformers (e.g., all-mpnet-base-v2) to generate vector embeddings for each chunk and the user's query. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Vector Database:**\n",
      "    * **Pinecone, Weaviate, Faiss (self-hosted):** Store the embeddings in a vector database optimized for similarity search.  These databases allow for efficient retrieval of the most similar chunks based on the query embedding.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Search and Ranking:**\n",
      "    * **Similarity Search:** When a user submits a query, generate its embedding and query the vector database for the most similar chunk embeddings.\n",
      "    * **Re-ranking with LLMs:**  Use a powerful LLM to re-rank the top retrieved chunks based on the specific query. This can involve factors like context, relevance, and even sentiment analysis.  This step significantly improves precision.\n",
      "    * **Hybrid Search:** Combine keyword search (e.g., Elasticsearch) with vector search to capture both explicit mentions and semantic similarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **User Interface:**\n",
      "    * **Intuitive Search Bar:** Allow users to enter natural language queries.\n",
      "    * **Snippet Display:** Display relevant snippets from the retrieved contracts, highlighting matching phrases.\n",
      "    * **Filtering and Faceting:** Enable filtering by contract metadata (e.g., date, type, parties involved).\n",
      "    * **Document Viewer:** Integrate a document viewer to display the full contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Cloud Services Implementation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This system can be effectively implemented using various cloud services:\n",

      "    * **Cloud Functions:** For handling user requests and orchestrating the workflow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Additional Considerations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Security:** Implement appropriate access controls and encryption to protect sensitive contract data.\n",
      "* **Scalability:** Design the system to handle a large volume of contracts and user queries.\n",
      "* **Maintainability:** Use modular design and version control for easy updates and maintenance.\n",
      "* **Cost Optimization:** Choose cost-effective cloud services and optimize resource utilization.\n",
      "* **Feedback Loop:** Collect user feedback to continuously improve the system's accuracy and relevance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

The combination of vector embeddings, LLMs, and cloud services allows for a cutting-edge solution that delivers highly relevant search results and improves contract management workflows.\n",
